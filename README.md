# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220. 

### A little about my studies:

* I am undertaking a degree in *computer* **science**
* This is my second year at [UOA](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html)

### I am taking STATS 220 because:

1. It looked like a related topic
2. I am interested in learning about new programming languages

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:<br>
